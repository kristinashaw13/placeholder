# CulinaryCompass
These code snippets are from my personal project, CulinaryCompass, a comprehensive web application designed to help users discover restaurants tailored to their unique experiences. Users can create personal accounts and customize their preferences based on dietary restrictions, tastes, and location.

CulinaryCompass is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, with Node.js handling backend functionality. It leverages Firebase as a database, Google Maps API for user location and restaurant mapping, and Hugging Face for an integrated chatbot.

The application begins by requiring users to create an account, as access to its features depends on personal preferences for a tailored experience. Without an account, users cannot fully utilize the site's functionalities. Once registered, users can explore all the application’s capabilities.

An integrated chatbot, located in the bottom-right corner of every page, is available to answer any quick questions—whether about food recommendations, substitutions, or more. There’s also a search bar at the top of the screen for easy navigation to key features, such as the map or community posts.

In the account tab, users can upload a profile picture and set their dietary restrictions and preferences. If needed, they can modify these preferences at any time.

The nearby restaurants tab lets users view physical markers on a map of restaurants in their vicinity. Hovering over a marker provides quick details, such as the type of cuisine and available options (e.g., vegetarian or vegan). Clicking on a marker reveals further information, including cuisine type, accommodations, phone number, rating, and address.

The community tab fosters a sense of connection among CulinaryCompass users, enabling them to share recipes, offer advice, and engage in conversations. Users can comment on posts and start threads, creating an interactive and welcoming space. Posts can also be deleted if the user prefers.

In the settings tab, users can manage core functionalities, including enabling notifications, location sharing, and active status visibility. If a user forgets their password or wants to reset it, they can initiate a password reset via email.

Overall, the application is highly versatile, bringing people together around something everyone loves: food.
